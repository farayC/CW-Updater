# What is this? 
In order to Crusader Wars to work with users playing Crusader Kings 3 with a different language other then english, it needs these language files, that are essentually the translation of cultures, heritages and men-at-arms names to a language as its in ck3 game files.

#Why we need this?
Crusader Wars reads the battle data from the |console_history.txt| and all names in the unit mappers files for cultures, heritages and MAA are in english, so if you are playing in a different language, ck3 logs all names of those in the using language, making the mod not be able to find any data and causing errors or weird bugs. 

#And the solution?
This files replace the english names of everything with the using language, making the mod now be able to find data and work correctly!

#What if a one Unit Mapper adds another MAA or Culture that is not translated here?
Simple, Unit Mappers can have a folder("languages") that does the same thing as it does here! It can add a translation, for MAA or Cultures, by using the same example as this ones on the folder, simply only adding the untranslated ones. 
Language files in a Unit Mapper just increments the data to these official files during playthrough.
